This portfolio can introduce me to people and show my professional skills that may be useful in work practice
My portfolio site have 6 pages and there is navgation bar for switching.For phones navigation bar folds and unfolds using JavaScript and CSS.
To show my interests,hobbes,skills,works and gallery I used <div> containers and "display: flex"
I made all of the pages responsive using this command: @media screen and (max-width: 600px)
To describe my works I used <figure> and <figcaption>
To design "My Background" page I used HTML symbols and lists
To design "Contacts" page I made a <div> element with width: 100vw and bottom: 0 to make half of background dark. Then I added my contacts and responsive links, so user could send message to email or call
Also I used Google Fonts

This webpage sometimes doesn't work in Chrome, but it works in Microsoft Edge
